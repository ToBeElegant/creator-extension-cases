* [First](https://docs.cocos.com/creator/3.0/manual/en/editor/extension/first.html) - Through this article, we will learn to create a Cocos Creator extension and execute a custom script through the extension.
* [Menu](https://docs.cocos.com/creator/3.0/manual/en/editor/extension/contributions-menu.html) - There is a main menu bar at the top of the editor, which can be used in the extensions.
* [Panel](https://docs.cocos.com/creator/3.0/manual/en/editor/extension/panel.html) - When implementing a function, it is likely to require UI interaction on the interface. Cocos Creator also provides this ability for extensions.
